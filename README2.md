# O365-on-Prem-AD
Off Boarding Script for O365 users and Hybrid Synced Environment

1) Understanding the scope of the script

   
Here’s a solid PowerShell-based offboarding script tailored for Office 365 users in a hybrid on-premises Active Directory (AD) environment. 
The script is updated to use GRAPH modules instead of AzureAD module, which supports MFA on admin accounts. The script automates key offboarding tasks such as:

Resets password to a random secure value
Disables the on-prem AD account
Moves user to the designated "OffBoarded Users" OU
Removes Office 365 licenses
Converts mailbox to shared
Removes all MFA methods and revokes sessions
Removes phone number
Removes user from Microsoft Teams and all Azure AD groups
Hides user from the Global Address List
Sends notification to IT via SMTP
Removes all assigned enterprise applications from a user in Azure AD
Logs all actions to: C:\Scripts\Offboarding\Logs

 

🧰 Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure:

PowerShell is installed
The following modules are available:
ActiveDirectory
AzureAD
MicrosoftTeamsand MS GRAPH module
You have the necessary admin permissions

⚙️ Configuration Highlights. You’ll need to customize

$Global:UsersOU – your source OU
$Global:MoveOffboardedOU – destination OU for offboarded users
$Global:EmailDomain, $Global:emailSmtpServer, etc. – for email forwarding and notifications
Logging paths and report directories

🧪 Usage
Run the script in a PowerShell session with elevated privileges. It includes a GUI prompt to select the user and then performs all configured offboarding steps.

 

2) Customizing the O365 hybrid offboarding script for our environment, I’ll need a few details as follows:
🏢 Active Directory Settings
Source OU (where active users are located):
e.g., OU=Employees,DC=yourdomain,DC=com

Destination OU (where offboarded users should be moved):
e.g., OU=OffboardedUsers,DC=yourdomain,DC=com

📧 Email Settings
Primary email domain (used for forwarding and notifications):
e.g., yourcompany.com

SMTP server for sending notifications (optional):
e.g., smtp.yourcompany.com

Email address to notify HR or IT (optional):
e.g., hr@yourcompany.com
